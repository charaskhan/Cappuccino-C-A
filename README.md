Coffee shop chains are becoming increasingly prevalent in Albania, with at least three of them being quite prominent and familiar to the average coffee drinker. In this context, we can explore the potential demand for a management system tailored for this sector.

Developing such a management system would necessitate a separation between the individual administration of each store and the 'back end' of the system, which focuses on managing the entire chain. Another distinction is between the service aspect (which encompasses both of the aforementioned sides) and the supply and storage component, which involves the storage and delivery of materials and supplies required for each outlet.

Coordinating each segment of the management system presents the most significant challenge, along with the necessity to investigate legislation, economics, and general business management principles to effectively design the system. Additionally, various schematics and diagrams will be essential to accurately conceptualize the system.
